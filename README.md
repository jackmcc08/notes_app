# Notes App

Makers Week 7 Afternoon Group Coding Challenge using javascript.

Notes App created by:
- Will - willspencer16
- Alex - yates101
- Stu - StuBehan
- Jack - jackmcc08

The was created with vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS. It also incorporates an emoji API to generate emojis based on shortcodes and utilise localContent on your browser to preserve the notes data.

As part of development we also created our own testing script - `Is it ducking working?`

The app is hosted on github pages, please visit the following on your browser (tested on chrome and firefox):
- Notes App: https://willspencer16.github.io/notes_app/
- Test page for App: https://willspencer16.github.io/notes_app/TestRunner.html
		- look in the console on developer tools (cmd + option + i) for output of all the tests.
